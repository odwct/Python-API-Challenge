Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship

- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude

- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


## VacationPy

1. Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df
2. Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition.
3. Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.
4. For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.
5. Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map
